# Platform Tour

Before we dive into details about the different functions available on the platform, let's first start with a brief 
tour of the main user interface so that we can refer to things using shared language.

1. **The main toolbar**: The main toolbar is used to navigate around the key areas of the RIR Platform. 
    Some of the icons may not be visible to you if you do not have administrator access on the platform.
2. **The indicator panel**: This panel contains a list of indicators that relate to health, security, human 
  welfare etc. The coloured circles next to each indicator shows the current severity level for that indicator.
  The indicators are arranged in groups which also have an severity level for the group. The entire collection
  of indicators is given an overall status at the top of the list.
