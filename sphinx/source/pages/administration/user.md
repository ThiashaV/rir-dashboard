1. **Signing In**:
In the top right-hand corner of the screen is the **sign-in** button. Here, you will sign in using your admin username and password. This process is the same for a staff user 
and an admin user.

Once you have created the user account, go back to **Site Administration** and select the **user** option. Select the user you created and then you can edit their personal information as well as select or deselect their ‘Permissions’. Remember to **Save** your changes.
