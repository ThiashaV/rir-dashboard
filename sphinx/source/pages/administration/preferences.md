To change or add icons to the RIR dashboard panel at the top of the screen, you will need to go to the **Site Administration** page. Under the group **Core**,
you will see **Site Preferences**. Click on this option and then you will be redirected to a new page, select **Site Preferences** again. Here you will be able
to change or edit the title as well as the icons. Save and refresh once you have made your edits.
